      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>[mission statement]My major is Computer Science, which is perfect for the type of job I would like to go into.
        The IT job options that interested me are Software/ Software design or Cybersecurity. I haven’t decided what exact job I would like,
        I’m stuck between a software developer and cybersecurity analyst. </p>
